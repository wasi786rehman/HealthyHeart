      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>WHAT IS CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFTING (CABG)?</strong></p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a type of surgery that improves blood flow to the heart. It's used for people who have severe&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cad/"><strong>coronary heart disease</strong></a> (CHD), also called coronary artery disease.</li>
        <li>CHD is a condition in which a substance called plaque builds up inside the coronary arteries. These arteries supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart. Plaque is made up of fat, cholesterol, calcium, and other substances found in the blood.</li>
        <li>Plaque can narrow or block the coronary arteries and reduce blood flow to the heart muscle. If the blockage is severe,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/angina/">angina</a> (chest pain or discomfort), shortness of breath, and, in some cases,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/heartattack/">heart attack</a>can occur.</li>
        <li>CABG is one treatment for CHD. This creates a new passage, and oxygen-rich blood is routed around the blockage to the heart muscle.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RECOVERY:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full recovery from CABG may take 6 to 12 weeks or more.</li>
        <li>Resume your activities of daily living early but slowly.</li>
        <li>The time of starting your physical activity again varies from person to person, but there are some typical timeframes. Most people can resume sexual activity within about 6-8 weeks and driving after 3 to 8 weeks.</li>
        <li>Returning to work after 6 weeks is common unless your job involves specific and demanding physical activity. Some people may need to find less physically demanding types of work or work a reduced schedule at first.</li>
        <li>Avoid any overhead lifting during first few weeks.</li>
        <li>Do not lift more than 2 to 4.5 kg of weight during first 3 months.</li>
        <li>Avoid pushing and pulling activities.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><strong>CONTINUE TAKING CARE OF YOUR HEART:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>Always remember that CABG is not a cure for&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/cad/">coronary heart disease</a>&nbsp;(CHD). You and your health care team may develop a treatment plan that includes lifestyle changes to help you stay healthy and reduce the chance of CHD getting worse. Focus on following points:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Lifestyle </strong><strong>modifications </strong>

          <p>Lifestyle changes may include making changes to your diet, quitting smoking, doing physical activity regularly, and lowering and managing stress.</p>
          <p>Your doctor also may refer you to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/rehab/">cardiac rehabilitation</a>&nbsp;(rehab). Cardiac rehab is a medically supervised program that helps improve the health and well-being of people who have heart problems. Rehab programs include exercise training, education on heart healthy living, and counselling to reduce stress and help you return to an active life.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <strong>Stick to your medications:</strong>

          <p>Taking medicines as prescribed also is an important part of care after surgery. Your doctor may prescribe medicines to manage pain during recovery; lower cholesterol and blood pressure; reduce the risk of blood clots forming; manage&nbsp;diabetes; or treat depression.</p>
