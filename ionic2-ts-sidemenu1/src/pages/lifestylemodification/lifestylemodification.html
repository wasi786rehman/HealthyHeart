        <li><strong>HEART HEALTHY DIET</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>A healthy diet is one of the best weapons you have to fight cardiovascular disease. The food you eat (and the amount) can affect other controllable risk factors: cholesterol, blood pressure, diabetes and overweight.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Eat a diet rich in vegetables .You should aim to 400-500g or five servings (5 servings x 80g) of fruits and vegetables per day.</li>
        <li>Eat a variety of seasonal fruits and vegetables (both cooked and as a salad).</li>
        <li>Include whole legumes such as moong daal, masoor daal,1 handful of nuts like walnut, almond, and seeds like pumpkin seed, melon seeds etc.</li>
        <li>High-fibre foods such as beans, sprouts, and whole grains are a great choice. Choose whole grain bread, cereal, and rice.</li>
        <li>Choose low-fat dairy products such as toned milk, skimmed milk, home-made paneer, chach, lassi etc.</li>
        <li>Eat fish at least twice a week.</li>
        <li>Select skinless chicken and choose lean cuts of meat. But, limit your intake of red meats such as mutton, beef.</li>
        <li>Limit your oil consumption to 3-4 tsp of oil per day.</li>
        <li>Practice alternating/blending of your cooking oil. Use different type of oils such as refined oil, sunflower oil,soyabean oil , olive oil.</li>
        <li>Avoid dalda, ghee, vanaspati etc.</li>
        <li>Limit how much saturated fat, trans fat and added sugars you eat. Such as baked goods, biscuits, cakes etc.</li>
        <li>Limit your sugar consumption to 3-4 tsp per day if you are not having diabetes.</li>
        <li>If you are diabetic take no or less sugar. Reduce consumption of simple sugars that are found in soda, candy and sugary desserts.</li>
        <li>Choose and prepare foods with little or no salt (sodium). Aim to consume no more than 1,500 mg of sodium per day.</li>
        <li>Cut down on salt. Use 3&frasl;4 tsp of salt per day. Do not sprinkle extra salt on your food.</li>
        <li>Use seasonings instead of salt to enhance the taste of food like lemon juice,vinegar,basil,garlic etc.</li>
        <li>Avoid use of papad, pickles, packaged food etc.</li>
        <li>Avoid consuming fast foods like burgers, fries, samosa, kachori, paranthas, sweets etc. It is one of the easiest way to reduce your intake of saturated fats.&nbsp;</li>

        <li><strong>BE PHYSICALLY ACTIVE: </strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>Resume your physical activity gradually after surgery. Be physically active every day. Your doctor and physiotherapist will develop an exercise program that is safe and beneficial. They will consider your fitness level, heart health, any physical limitations, the amount, intensity and duration of exercise needed to improve heart health, and the need for supervision. Being physically active is important to prevent heart disease.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>Important points:</strong></p>
      <p>Following points you should keep in your mind while doing exercises:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Frequency </strong>&ndash; The recommended frequency of exercise is 3-5times a week.</li>
        <li><strong>Content and duration</strong> &ndash; It is important that each session consist of :</li>
        <li><strong>Warm-up phase</strong> -5- to 10-minute,</li>
        <li><strong>Conditioning phase -</strong>at least 20 minutes,</li>
        <li><strong>Cool-down phase</strong> &ndash;5- to 10-minute</li>
        <li><strong>Intensity</strong> &ndash;Intensity of exercise should be moderate.</li>
        <li><strong>Exercise progression</strong> &ndash; Over time, most people can gradually increase the level of exercise in the workout. Beneficial exercise can also be built in to the daily routine by taking a brisk walk or enjoying active play with children or grandchildren.</li>

        <li><strong> RESUMING SEXUAL ACTIVITY</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>An important issue for many patients who have had bypass surgery is when sexual activity can be safely resumed. In the first few weeks after an&nbsp;uncomplicated&nbsp;heart attack, most people are at high risk of heart-related problems during sex as a result of a rise in the heart rate and blood pressure. However, this risk becomes much smaller by 6-8weeks after surgery.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Assume positions which can avoid strain on sternum and incision.</li>
        <li>Extra pillows can help you to feel comfortable.</li>
      </ul>

    <div *ngIf="item==8">
      <ol start="9">
        <li><strong> FOLLOW UP:</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <p>&nbsp;Follow-up care is of great importance since people who have had bypass surgery have a significantly increased risk of more cardiac events, including recurrent chest pain, heart attack, heart failure, and an increased risk of dying. The risk of these problems is greatly reduced by closely following a clinician's recommendations for rehabilitation, follow-up visits, and treatments. Over time, the treatment plan may change as heart health improves or other medical problems develop.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>TIPS:</strong></p>
      <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow up your doctor on time.</li>
        <li>Get your investigations done on time.</li>
        <li>Check your B.P, blood sugar level as advised and record it.</li>
